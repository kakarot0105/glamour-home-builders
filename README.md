# Jai Guru Datta Residency Website

This repository contains a lightweight, static website for Shambhavi Constructions showcasing their ongoing project,
**Jai Guru Datta Residency**.

## Getting started

To preview the site locally, open `index.html` in a web browser. All assets, including the project brochure PDF, reside
within the `shambhavi-site` directory.

## Development & maintenance

The site uses plain HTML and CSS for maximum portability. To add new sections or projects, edit the HTML and CSS files as
needed. You can duplicate the existing section structure to create pages for completed projects. As the site grows,
consider migrating to a component-based framework such as Next.js or Astro for better maintainability.

## Deployment

For a simple deployment, push this repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages on the default branch. Alternatively,
upload the contents of the `shambhavi-site` directory to any static hosting service, such as Netlify, Vercel or your
preferred web server.
